# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Kickstarter data analysis to assess trend

## Overview of Project
In this project I will help Louise, a playwright, analyze data collected from various crowdfunding campaigns to study and then visualize how campaign launch dates and funding goals impact the outcome of Kickstarters.  

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the factors contributing to a successful Kickstarter campaign outcome. This project will focus on two key considerations: Outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals. Through data analysis and visualization, a recommendation will be made as to what constitutes an effective campaign for funding. 

**###Analysis and Challenges**
Although information about other subcategories that were cancelled was available, there were no plays that withdrew from their respective campaigns which can limit the available data for Louise in that regard. Data about goals and pledges of cancelled plays could help draw a crucial conclusion about the outcome. They would be helpful to analyze if plays were cancelled because of funding, time lapsed since launch of the campaign other reasons. 

  Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Trends of Successful and Failed campaigns based on launch date somewhat mimic each other. This means that a lot of shows had a successful campaign between May-July and more shows also failed during that time. This could be ambiguous for Louise and would need more contributing factors for decision making. 

 Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	
Plays are likely to succeed if the goal is either less than 5000 or between 35000 and 40000. Majority of failed shows had a goal ranging from $15000 and up. Unlike data of Outcome by Launch Dates, the graph does a good job of showing an inverse correlation. Trends are the opposite of each other suggesting that for the given goal amount as the percentage of successful plays decreases, that of the failed plays increases. 

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
     When looking at the Outcomes based on Goals graph, it could be better to standardize all the data set before analyzing percentage of outcomes. For instance, for outcomes between goals of $45,000 and $49,999, the graph suggests that 100% of shows failed and since no or 0% of successful show are found in this region, it could mislead Louise or other clients. What the graph fails to show is that there was only one failed show in this goal area. It would be intuitive to include how many of each show is in the category to give a better insight into the reader. 

#### Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Most successful plays launched their crowdfunding in the months May, June and July with May being the peak. 
Launch dates do not seem to influence outcome of cancelled plays. The number of cancelled shows more or less stayed the same throughout the year.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
As per “Outcomes Based on Goal” chart, nearly 3/4th of all Shows are likely to become successful if their funding goals are less than $4,999. In contrast, plays asking for a goal greater than 50,000 are prone to failure.  

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data is too broad. It encompasses a lot of parent and subcategories, but Louise is only interested in funding her theatre campaign. Although it is easy to filter out data, it would have been beneficial to Louise if there was more data on plays instead. It would have been insightful if the plays further broke down into the genre so that Louise could see if there is any correlation between type of play and pledged money or success. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a diagram with how long campaigns lasted to study their outcome. Are campaigns more successful if their short or extended? It would also be informative if we could graph the ratio of pledged and goal against the different outcomes to analyze how realistic the goals were and how that related to the amount pledged essentially influencing success/failure.
